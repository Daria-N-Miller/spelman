About MedKoo

MedKoo is a chemistry based small biotech business with a major focus on chemical synthesis of small molecule drugs discovered by other scientists. All of our products are supplied as chemical reagents in pure form, and are intended for scientific research use only. At this moment, MedKoo does NOT supply GMP, DMF or ISO certified products. Moreover, MedKoo also does not provide any controlled substances. MedKoo is NOT a FDA approved manufacturer, therefore, our products cannot be used for clinical trials or disease treatment.

 

MedKoo was founded in 2009 by Dr. Qingqi Chen, who obtained a PhD in synthetic chemistry from Peking University, and received postdoctoral trainings at Johannes-Kepler University Linz (with Dr. Heinz Falk), University of Nevada Reno (with Dr. David Lightner), and University of British Columbia (with Dr. David Dolphin). Dr. Chen is currently the President and CEO of MedKoo. Prior to starting at MedKoo, Dr. Chen was a distinguished professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Zhongshan University (Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China). Dr. Chen also held senior positions in several pharmaceutical companies in USA, where he made some contributions to the R&D of several FDA approved drugs. Dr. Chen has a strong interest in new drug discovery, drug synthesis, medicinal chemistry, who has published over 100 papers, submitted over 20 patent applications, and authorized or co-authorized 11 books, which were related to new drug discovery, drug synthesis and drug patents.

 

MedKoo has stragetic collaborators in RTP, North Carolina who can synthesize highly-challenge bioactive molecules. MedKoo has also established a very comprehensive and highly efficient supply network, which allows us to offer biochemical products from mgs to kilograms at the most competive prices.  Note:  We have some partners and suppliers in China, however, we do not have a branch in China. Therefore orders will not be shipped from China to customers. All orders, technical  support and customer services are being handled by our USA headquarter. All orders are being shipped from our company in North Carolina, USA.

Investment Approach

BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.’s (HYT) (the 'Trust') primary investment objective is to provide shareholders with current income. The Trust’s secondary investment objective is to provide shareholders with capital appreciation. The Trust seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in domestic and foreign high yield securities, including high yield bonds (commonly referred to as 'junk' bonds), corporate loans, convertible debt securities and preferred securities which are below investment grade quality. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.

No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

A SOURCE OF HIGH INCOME

High yield bonds have historically provided higher levels of income than core bonds*

FLEXIBILITY FOR CHANGING MARKETS

Sustainability Characteristics

To be included in MSCI ESG Fund Ratings, 65% of the fund’s gross weight must come from securities with ESG coverage by MSCI ESG Research (certain cash positions and other asset types deemed not relevant for ESG analysis by MSCI are removed prior to calculating a fund’s gross weight; the absolute values of short positions are included but treated as uncovered), the fund’s holdings date must be less than one year old, and the fund must have at least ten securities. For newly launched funds, Sustainability Characteristics are typically available 6 months after launch. MSCI Ratings are currently unavailable for this fund.
Business Involvement

Business Involvement metrics can help investors gain a more comprehensive view of specific activities in which a fund may be exposed through its investments.

Business Involvement metrics are not indicative of a fund’s investment objective, and, unless otherwise stated in fund documentation and included within a fund’s investment objective, do not change a fund’s investment objective or constrain the fund’s investable universe. For more information regarding a fund's investment strategy, please see the fund's prospectus.

Review the MSCI methodology behind the Business Involvement metrics, using links below.

MSCI - UN Global Compact Violators as of - -
MSCI - Nuclear Weapons as of - -
MSCI - Thermal Coal as of - -
MSCI - Civilian Firearms as of - -
MSCI - Oil Sands as of - -
MSCI - Tobacco as of - -
Business Involvement Coverage as of - -
Percentage of Fund not covered as of - -
BlackRock business involvement exposures as shown above for Thermal Coal and Oil Sands are calculated and reported for companies that generate more than 5% of revenue from thermal coal or oil sands as defined by MSCI ESG Research. For the exposure to companies that generate any revenue from thermal coal or oil sands (at a 0% revenue threshold), as defined by MSCI ESG Research, it is as follows: Thermal Coal -% and for Oil Sands -%.

Business Involvement metrics are calculated by BlackRock using data from MSCI ESG Research which provides a profile of each company’s specific business involvement. BlackRock leverages this data to provide a summed up view across holdings and translates it to a fund's market value exposure to the listed Business Involvement areas above.

Business Involvement metrics are designed only to identify companies where MSCI has conducted research and identified as having involvement in the covered activity. As a result, it is possible there is additional involvement in these covered activities where MSCI does not have coverage. This information should not be used to produce comprehensive lists of companies without involvement. Business Involvement metrics are only displayed if at least 1% of the fund’s gross weight includes securities covered by MSCI ESG Research.
ESG Integration

ESG integration is the practice of incorporating material environmental, social and governance (ESG) information or insights alongside traditional measures into the investment decision process to improve long term financial outcomes of portfolios. Unless otherwise stated in Fund documentation or included within the Fund’s investment objective, inclusion of this statement does not imply that the Fund has an ESG-aligned investment objective, but rather describes how ESG information is considered as part of the overall investment process.

The Fund manager includes ESG considerations in the investment research, portfolio construction, and investment monitoring phases of the investment process. The Fund manager maintains internal ESG scorecards for new primary issuers under consideration for investment and existing issuers of publicly traded securities. These scorecards analyze and track internal and external research views across a range of environmental, social, and governance factors sourced from primary and third party ESG information and research. Portfolio management teams consider the sector and issuer ESG views and scores when selecting individual investments during portfolio construction. ESG factors are debated and considered in investment decisions. The Fund manager also considers ESG criteria during post-investment monitoring and conducts regular portfolio risk reviews with the Risk and Quantitative Analysis group. These reviews include discussion of the portfolio’s exposure to material ESG risks.

If the Fund invests in any underlying fund, certain portfolio information, including sustainability characteristics and business-involvement metrics, provided for the Fund may include information (on a look-through basis) of such underlying fund, to the extent available.

For funds with an investment objective that include the integration of ESG criteria, there may be corporate actions or other situations that may cause the fund or index to passively hold securities that may not comply with ESG criteria. Please refer to the fund’s prospectus for more information. The screening applied by the fund's index provider may include revenue thresholds set by the index provider. The information displayed on this website may not include all of the screens that apply to the relevant index or the relevant fund. These screens are described in more detail in the fund’s prospectus, other fund documents, and the relevant index methodology document.

Certain information contained herein (the “Information”) has been provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC, a RIA under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and may include data from its affiliates (including MSCI Inc. and its subsidiaries (“MSCI”)), or third party suppliers (each an “Information Provider”), and it may not be reproduced or redisseminated in whole or in part without prior written permission. The Information has not been submitted to, nor received approval from, the US SEC or any other regulatory body. The Information may not be used to create any derivative works, or in connection with, nor does it constitute, an offer to buy or sell, or a promotion or recommendation of, any security, financial instrument or product or trading strategy, nor should it be taken as an indication or guarantee of any future performance, analysis, forecast or prediction. Some funds may be based on or linked to MSCI indexes, and MSCI may be compensated based on the fund’s assets under management or other measures. MSCI has established an information barrier between equity index research and certain Information. None of the Information in and of itself can be used to determine which securities to buy or sell or when to buy or sell them. The Information is provided “as is” and the user of the Information assumes the entire risk of any use it may make or permit to be made of the Information. Neither MSCI ESG Research nor any Information Party makes any representations or express or implied warranties (which are expressly disclaimed), nor shall they incur liability for any errors or omissions in the Information, or for any damages related thereto. The foregoing shall not exclude or limit any liability that may not by applicable law be excluded or limited.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.

Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.

The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.

Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).

Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Although BlackRock shall obtain data from sources that BlackRock considers reliable, all data contained herein is provided “as is” and BlackRock makes no representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, with respect to such data, the timeliness thereof, the results to be obtained by the use thereof or any other matter. BlackRock expressly disclaims any and all implied warranties, including without limitation, warranties of originality, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
